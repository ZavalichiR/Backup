      previous article about the socket programming. In the earlier article we
      created a client but that client used to make blocking IO calls ( Receive
      ) to read data at regular intervals (via clicking the Rx button). But as I
      said in my earlier article, that model does not work very well in a real
      world application. Also since Windows is an events-based system, the
      application (client) should get notifications of some kind whenever the
      data is received so that client can read it rather than client
      continuously polling for data . </font></td>
